# MicroUSB2DIP

## Overview
![Main Preview](assets/img/main.png)

This is an open-source reverse-engineered version of a Micro USB to DIP adapter, based on the original component available [here](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32947889760.html). The goal of this project was to practice reverse engineering as a learning exercise and to prepare for a future adaptation in a larger project.

## Purpose
- **Reverse engineering**: Understanding the design and functionality of the original adapter.
- **Skill development**: Improving PCB design and hardware analysis skills.
- **Future adaptation**: Using the knowledge gained to design a custom version for a more complex project.
